/*
 * Category : Behaviour
 * 
 * Objective : Define the structure/skeleton of an algorithm by assigning certain steps to it sub-classes
 * 
 * Result : Permits the isolation of variable parts in an algorithm 
 * 
 * Reason : A class has a gloal fonctionning, but the details of its algorithm should 
 *  be specified in sub-classes
